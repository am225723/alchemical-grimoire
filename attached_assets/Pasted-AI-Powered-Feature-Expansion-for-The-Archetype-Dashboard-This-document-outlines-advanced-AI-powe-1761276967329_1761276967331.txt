AI-Powered Feature Expansion for "The Archetype Dashboard"
​This document outlines advanced, AI-powered features designed to be integrated into the existing shadow_work_webapp_lesson_plan.md. These features leverage a large language model (like Gemini) to transform the user experience from a self-guided set of tools into a responsive, personalized, and deeply interactive journey.
​1. AI-Enhanced Module Activities (Upgrades to Existing Tools)
​This section details how to upgrade each of your existing webapp activities with AI to make them more dynamic and insightful.
​Module 1: "The Dynamic Trigger Analyzer"
​Replaces: "The Trigger Identifier" (Static Quiz)
​AI Function: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Analysis.
​How it Works:
​Instead of a quiz, the user is presented with a text box: "Describe a recent situation that made you feel angry, anxious, or frustrated. What happened? What did the other person do or say?"
​The user writes a free-form journal entry (e.g., "My co-worker presented my idea as their own in the meeting. I felt invisible and furious, but I just sat there and said nothing.").
​AI Analysis: The AI analyzes the text, identifies key emotional and archetypal keywords ("furious," "said nothing," "invisible"), and provides a personalized result.
​AI Result: "Thank you for sharing. I'm hearing a few things in your story:
​A feeling of being 'invisible' and 'saying nothing' suggests your Victim archetype might be active.
​The 'furious' feeling about a boundary being crossed (your idea being stolen) points to the 'gold' of your Rebel or Tyrant wanting to stand up for you.
​Let's start by exploring the Victim module."
​Module 3: "The Socratic Reframe Coach"
​Replaces: "The Victim-to-Victor Reframer" (Static Tool)
​AI Function: Conversational AI (Chatbot) role-playing as a Socratic coach.
​How it Works:
​The user inputs their "Victim" thought: "My boss is drowning me in work and stressing me out."
​The AI initiates a 1-on-1 chat, asking one question at a time to guide the user to their own solution.
​AI Coach: "That sounds incredibly stressful. I hear that you feel powerless right now. Let's get curious. What is one part of this situation, no matter how small, that you do have control over?"
​User: "I guess I could tell him I'm swamped."
​AI Coach: "That's a powerful first step. What is one choice you could make about that? What would it look like to communicate your bandwidth clearly and professionally?"
​The AI guides the user to craft their own "Victor" statement, making the insight feel earned, not given.
​Module 5: "The Saboteur Interview"
​Replaces: "A Letter from Your Saboteur" (Static Template)
​AI Function: Conversational AI (Chatbot) with dynamic role-playing.
​How it Works:
​The app prompts the user to "talk to" their Saboteur. The AI adopts the persona of the Saboteur, responding from a place of (misguided) protection.
​User: "Why are you making me procrastinate on applying for this new job?"
​AI (as Saboteur): "Because I'm trying to protect you. What if you don't get it? You'll feel so humiliated. It's safer to just stay where you are, even if you're unhappy. At least it's familiar."
​User: "But I'm willing to risk that. I want to try."
​AI (as Saboteur): "Are you sure? What if you do get it? The work will be harder. The expectations will be higher. What if you're not good enough and they find out you're a fraud? I'm just trying to save you from that."
​This interaction allows the user to externalize the voice, understand its fear, and practice reassuring it, which is a key integration skill.
​Module 6: "The Judgment De-Coder"
​Replaces: "The Judgment Tracker & Reframe" (Static Log)
​AI Function: Deeper analysis and "shadow-to-gold" translation.
​How it Works:
​The user logs their judgment: "I can't stand how fake and 'sales-y' my co-worker is. He's so inauthentic."
​AI Analysis: The AI provides a multi-level insight.
​AI Result: "That's a powerful judgment. Here's what it might be telling you:
​The Archetype: This is a classic Judge observation.
​The Projection: We often judge "fakeness" in others when we have a 'People-Pleaser' part that is also 'fake' (inauthentic) in order to be liked.
​The 'Gold': This judgment reveals a deep, powerful core value for you: Authenticity.
​Integration: How could you practice being 10% more authentic today, to honor that value?"
​2. New Advanced AI Features
​These are entirely new features that become the app's "premium" or "advanced" offering, creating a truly personalized, ongoing support system.
​Feature A: The "Inner Council" AI Chat Coach
​Core Feature: A persistent, conversational AI chatbot (trained with a specific system prompt) available on every page of the app.
​System Prompt: The AI is instructed to act as a compassionate, non-judgmental shadow-work facilitator. Its goal is not to give advice, but to ask curious questions that help the user identify which archetype is "speaking" in that moment.
​How it Works (Real-time Triage):
​User (anytime): "I'm so angry at my partner right now for no reason!"
​AI Coach: "I hear you. That's a valid and powerful feeling. Let's get curious about where it's coming from.
​Does it feel like the Tyrant (angry that a plan or expectation was broken)?
​Does it feel like the Martyr (angry from feeling unappreciated)?
​Does it feel like the Rebel (angry from feeling controlled or suffocated)?
​The user's answer then directs them to the right tool (e.g., "It feels like the Rebel" -> "Great insight. Let's try the 'Reactive vs. Authentic No' tool for this situation.").
​Feature B: The "Daily Journal Analyzer" (Dashboard AI)
​Replaces: The manual sliders in Module 8.
​AI Function: NLP analysis to power the "Archetype Dashboard" automatically.
​How it Works:
​The user's "Integration Log" becomes their primary daily journal.
​Each day, the user writes a simple entry: "Tired today. My team dropped the ball, so I had to stay late to fix everything. Nobody even said thank you. I'm so sick of it. I just want to quit."
​AI Analysis: The AI scans this text in the background.
​Result (Dynamic Dashboard): The user's "Archetype Dashboard" updates automatically. The Martyr slider goes to 90%, the Tyrant to 60%, and the Victim to 50%. The dashboard then proactively suggests the most relevant tool.
​Dashboard Prompt: "Good morning. I noticed in your journal entry yesterday that your Martyr archetype was very active ('stayed late,' 'nobody said thank you'). Before you start your day, let's use the 'Yes/No' Need Sorter to practice setting one clear boundary."
​Feature C: Grounded Integration (AI + Google Search)
​AI Function: Using the Google Search tool (tools: [{"google_search": {}}]) to connect inner work with real-world action.
​How it Works:
​A user has completed the Tyrant module and identified their "gold" is "leadership."
​They go to the AI Coach: "I want to integrate my Tyrant's 'gold.' How can I practice being a good leader instead of a micromanaging boss?"
​AI Action: The AI recognizes this as a request for external information. It calls the Google Search tool with a query like "how to delegate effectively" or "tips for new managers".
​AI Result (Grounded): "That's a fantastic integration goal. I've found some practical advice on this. According to [Source], one of the first steps in healthy leadership is effective delegation. Key tips include:
​Clearly define the desired outcome, but don't dictate the method.
​Grant full authority and responsibility for the task.
​Set a clear check-in time, which allows you to trust the process instead of micromanaging.
​Integration: "How could you apply one of these tips to a small task at work this week?"

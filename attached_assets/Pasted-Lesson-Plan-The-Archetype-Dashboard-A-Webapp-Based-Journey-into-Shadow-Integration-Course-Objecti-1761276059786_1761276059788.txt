Lesson Plan: The Archetype Dashboard

A Webapp-Based Journey into Shadow Integration

Course Objective

This lesson plan provides the full curriculum and feature-set for an interactive webapp designed to guide users through shadow work. It moves beyond theory by providing concrete, real-world examples of how shadow archetypes impact life and features interactive tools to help users identify, understand, and integrate them. The goal is to build a practical, lifelong toolkit for self-awareness.

Core Webapp Features

User Dashboard: A personal, dynamic homepage where users can track which archetypes are most "active" in their life, based on their inputs.

Modular Progression: Users unlock one module at a time, ensuring they build a foundational understanding before moving to more complex topics.

Interactive Tools: Each module contains a unique tool (quizzes, sorters, reframers, trackers) instead of just text-based prompts. This focus on action over reading enhances engagement and insight.

"Integration Log": A central, private journal where insights, reframes, and "aha" moments from all tools are automatically saved for the user to review, track patterns, and see their growth over time.

Module 1: Welcome to Your Shadow

Objective: To introduce the shadow in a non-threatening way, de-stigmatize the concept, and have the user complete their first interactive diagnostic to build engagement.

Expanded Concepts (The "What" & "Why")

What is the Shadow? The shadow is not your "evil" side. It's your "disowned" side. It's a psychological "backpack" you've been carrying since childhood. In this backpack, you stuffed away all the parts of you that were deemed "unacceptable," "too much," or "not enough" by your family, school, or society. This includes "negative" traits like rage or jealousy, but also, crucially, "positive" traits like ambition, vulnerability, or creativity, which may have been shamed out of you.

How Does it Affect Your Life? The shadow doesn't stay in the backpack; it leaks out. Its main function is projection.

Projection: This is the act of seeing your own disowned traits in others. When you have a highly emotional, 10/10-level reaction to a trait in someone else (e.g., "I can't stand how arrogant he is!"), you are often seeing your own disowned shadow. You may have disowned your own healthy pride or ambition (which looks like arrogance) to be "humble." Your soul wants to be whole, so it points out the missing pieces in everyone around you.

Triggers: A trigger is simply a "shadow-sighting." When you are triggered, it's a compass pointing directly at an unhealed, un-integrated part of you. This app will teach you to see triggers as data, not drama. They are your personalized map back to wholeness.

Webapp Activity: "The Trigger Identifier" (Diagnostic Quiz)

Format: A multi-page quiz. The user is presented with 20-25 common "triggers."

User Action: The user rates each trigger on a 3-point scale:

0 - Doesn't bother me.

1 - Annoying.

2 - Makes me deeply angry/anxious.

Sample Triggers:

"When someone is lazy and doesn't pull their weight."

"When someone is a 'control freak' and tries to micromanage me."

"When someone plays the 'victim' and won't take responsibility."

"When someone constantly sacrifices their needs and then complains about it."

"When someone is highly critical or judgmental of others."

"When someone breaks the rules just for the sake of it."

"When someone is 'fake' or a people-pleaser."

"When someone is loud, attention-seeking, and 'too much'."

"When someone is weak and won't stand up for themselves."

Result: The app calculates which triggers scored highest and presents a "provisional" archetype profile.

Example Result: "Your highest scores relate to laziness, criticism, and people-pleasing. This suggests your Judge and Martyr archetypes might be very active. This dashboard will help you see why. Let's start by exploring the Judge."

Module 2: The Tyrant (The Shadow of Power)

Expanded Concepts (What is it?)

The Archetype: The Tyrant is a part of you that is terrified of chaos, vulnerability, and being seen as "incompetent" or "out of control." To protect itself, it uses control, rigidity, and force (of will, criticism, or rules) as a weapon. It operates on the core belief: "If I can control everything and everyone around me, I can't be hurt, and things will be 'safe'."

Internal Voice: "It must be done this way." "I'll just do it myself, no one else gets it right." "Why is everyone so incompetent?" "If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself." "This is a mess, I have to fix it."

How it Affectes Your Life:

At Work: You are a micromanager. You can't delegate because you don't trust anyone else, leading to your own burnout. You over-correct small mistakes and suffocate your team's creativity. Your team feels resentful, anxious, and uncreative around you.

In Relationships: You try to "fix" your partner. You control the finances, the social schedule, what they eat, or even how they "should" feel. This leads to explosive fights over "the right way" to do something as simple as load the dishwasher. Your partner feels like a child, not an equal.

Internal: You suffer from high-functioning anxiety, chronic tension, perfectionism, and rigidity. You can't relax or be spontaneous. A change of plans (like traffic) feels like a personal attack. You feel a constant, low-level hum of frustration.

The "Gold" (Hidden Strength): Natural leadership, decisiveness, a gift for creating order from chaos, the ability to build safe and stable structures, and a powerful sense of responsibility.

Webapp Activity: "The Control-Fear Matrix" (Dynamic Form)

Format: A two-column interactive list.

User Action:

Column 1 (Text Input): The app prompts, "List a 'control behavior' you recognize." (e.g., "I re-read emails 10 times before sending," "I plan my vacations down to the minute," "I criticize how my partner dresses," "I must clean the kitchen before bed.")

Column 2 (Dropdown/Input): The app prompts, "What is this behavior protecting you from?" (e.g., "Being seen as stupid," "Things going wrong," "Feeling embarrassed," "My day feeling chaotic," "My partner being judged, which reflects on me.")

Result: The app saves this entry to the user's "Integration Log," creating a clear map: Control Tactic → Underlying Fear. This shifts the user's perspective from "I'm a control freak" (judgment) to "I have a part that is deeply afraid of X" (compassion).

Module 3: The Victim (The Shadow of Helplessness)

Expanded Concepts (What is it?)

The Archetype: The Victim believes that life happens to them. They feel fundamentally powerless against other people, systems, and circumstances. This is often "learned helplessness" rooted in childhood where their choices were truly taken away. As an adult, this pattern persists, and it becomes a "perverted" form of power: "You can't blame me or expect anything of me, I'm powerless."

Internal Voice: "It's not my fault." "Why does this always happen to me?" "I can't..." "If only 

$$someone$$

 would change, then I could be happy." "No one understands what I'm going through."

How it Affects Your Life:

At Work: You avoid responsibility. When a project fails, you have a list of external excuses (not enough time, unhelpful colleagues, unclear instructions). You are seen as unreliable and are passed over for promotions, which reinforces your belief that "the system is unfair."

In Relationships: You use passive-aggression ("I'm fine." slams cabinet). You manipulate with guilt or by appearing "weak," making your partner feel responsible for your happiness. This attracts "Rescuer" or "Tyrant" partners, creating a toxic co-dependent cycle.

Internal: You feel "stuck," resentful, and jealous of others' success (attributing it to "luck"). You are passively waiting for a hero—a new boss, partner, or opportunity—to save you, so you never take the small, concrete actions to save yourself.

The "Gold" (Hidden Strength): Deep empathy, profound sensitivity, the ability to ask for help (when healthy), a talent for building community, and a powerful way of relating to those who are suffering.

Webapp Activity: "The Victim-to-Victor Reframer" (Interactive Tool)

Format: A two-part tool.

User Action:

Part 1 (Text Input): The app prompts, "Write a recent 'Victim' thought." (e.g., "My boss is drowning me in work and stressing me out," or "My partner never helps around the house.")

Part 2 (Guided Reframing): The app guides the user to "find the choice" in the situation, no matter how small. It asks a series of questions:

"What part of this situation, even 1%, is in your control?"

"What is one small action you could take to feel 5% more powerful?"

"Re-write your thought from a place of power, starting with 'I will...'"

Example Reframe: "My boss has assigned a lot of work. I will choose to speak with them tomorrow about my bandwidth and set a boundary." or "My partner isn't helping. I will choose to stop silently stewing and clearly state what I need."

Result: The user saves the "Victor" statement to their log, physically practicing the pivot from helplessness to agency.

Module 4: The Martyr (The Shadow of Self-Sacrifice)

Expanded Concepts (What is it?)

The Archetype: The Martyr is driven by a core belief: "My needs don't matter" and "I am only worthy if I am useful to others." They must be needed. They over-give, ignore their own boundaries, and burn out, then feel deeply resentful. Their giving is not a gift; it's a transaction for which they subconsciously expect love, appreciation, or "moral superiority."

Internal Voice: "After all I've done for them..." "It's fine, I'll just do it myself." (Followed by a sigh). "No one sees how much I do." "They're so selfish, I would never do that."

How it Affects Your Life:

At Work: You are the one who always stays late, always says yes to new projects, and always covers for others. You are exhausted and resentful, gossiping about "lazy" colleagues. You can't accept help or compliments because that would remove your "useful" status.

In Relationships: You "perform" for love. You do all the chores, manage the family, and sacrifice your own hobbies, hoping your partner will "finally" see and appreciate you. This makes your partner feel indebted, guilty, and suffocated, not loving. You create the very distance you're trying to prevent.

Internal: You have no idea what you actually want or need. Your entire identity is built on doing for others. You feel empty, exhausted, and chronically under-appreciated. You are angry, but you feel guilty about being angry.

The "Gold" (Hidden Strength): Boundless compassion, true generosity (when unhooked from resentment), nurturing energy, and a deep capacity to care for others.

Webapp Activity: "The 'Yes/No' Need Sorter" (Trello-style Sorter)

Format: The app presents the user with a series of digital "cards." Each card has a common scenario.

User Action: The user must drag and drop each card into one of three buckets:

My "Joyful Yes" (I want to do this, and I expect nothing back).

My "Boundaried No" (I cannot or will not do this right now. This is a complete sentence).

My "Martyr Yes" (I'll do it... but I'll be resentful/expect something).

Sample Cards: "Your boss asks you to work late on a Friday." "Your friend asks for a big favor when you're already exhausted." "Your partner wants to watch a movie you hate." "Your child wants you to play, but you're depleted."

Result: The app shows the user their "Martyr Pile" and asks, "What is one 'Martyr Yes' you can turn into a 'Boundaried No' this week?" This visual sorting makes the hidden pattern of resentment undeniable.

Module 5: The Saboteur (The Shadow of Self-Undermining)

Expanded Concepts (What is it?)

The Archetype: The Saboteur is a twisted protector. It's terrified of failure, judgment, and success. Its logic is: "If you fail, you'll be humiliated. If you succeed, you'll have new responsibilities you can't handle and then you'll fail, which is even worse." It "saves" you from this fate by cutting your legs out from under you right before the finish line.

Internal Voice: (Often silent, manifests as behaviors). "I'll start tomorrow." "It's not perfect yet." "This is good enough, why try harder?" "This is boring." "What's the point?"

How it Affects Your Life:

At Work: This is the master of procrastination. You'll wait until the last minute. Or, it's perfectionism—you'll spend 10 hours on a 1-hour task and miss the deadline. You "conveniently" get sick before a big presentation or "forget" to send a key email.

In Relationships: Just when things are getting serious and intimate, you start a fight, find a "fatal flaw" in your partner ("I can't stand the way they chew"), or "forget" a key date. You sabotage the relationship to "protect" yourself from the vulnerability of being truly seen and loved (and potentially abandoned).

Internal: You feel intense frustration and self-hatred. "Why do I always do this?" You feel like your own worst enemy, trapped in a cycle of starting strong and then falling apart.

The "Gold" (Hidden Strength): A powerful protective instinct, an ability to "pump the brakes" when you're moving too fast or out of alignment with your true values, and a signpost pointing to your deepest desires (you only sabotage what you truly want).

Webapp Activity: "A Letter from Your Saboteur" (Guided Text Editor)

Format: A digital "letter" template.

User Action: The app prompts the user to write a letter from the perspective of their Saboteur. This is a powerful externalization exercise. It provides guiding prompts:

"Dear [User's Name], I am the part of you that... [User fills in the blank, e.g., 'makes you procrastinate']."

"I am doing this because I am trying to protect you from... [e.g., 'failing,' 'being judged,' 'getting hurt,' 'succeeding and not being able to handle it']."

"The thing I am *most* afraid of is... [e.g., 'that you're not good enough and people will find out']."

"What I need from you to feel safe is... [e.g., 'to take smaller steps,' 'to be reassured that it's okay to fail']."

Result: This externalizes the voice and helps the user see it as a scared part to be reassured, not an enemy to be fought. It shifts the inner dialogue from "I have to beat my saboteur" to "I have to reassure my saboteur."

Module 6: The Judge (The Shadow of Criticism)

Expanded Concepts (What is it?)

The Archetype: The Judge is the voice of perfectionism and "shoulds." It was often formed by internalizing the critical voices of parents, teachers, or society. It has two modes: The Inner Critic attacks you ("You're so stupid") to "motivate" you through shame, and the Outer Critic attacks others ("They're so stupid") to make you feel superior and separate from what you fear.

Internal Voice: "You're so stupid/lazy/fat/disorganized." "You should have known better." "Look at them, what a mess." "At least I'm not that bad."

How it Affects Your Life:

At Work: You are paralyzed by perfectionism, afraid to submit any work that isn't flawless. Or, you are the harsh boss/colleague who nitpicks everyone's work, creating a toxic, fear-based environment. You are highly judgmental in meetings, which silences others.

In Relationships: You constantly criticize your partner—their clothes, their friends, their way of speaking. You make them feel "not good enough" and like they're walking on eggshells. This is often a projection of your own insecurities and the high standards you place on yourself.

Internal: You suffer from low self-esteem, chronic anxiety, and depression. You feel no "unconditional" love for yourself. Your worth is always conditional on your last achievement or failure.

The "Gold" (Hidden Strength): Discernment, wisdom, high standards, a desire for truth, clarity, a drive for excellence, and a strong sense of justice.

Webapp Activity: "The Judgment Tracker & Reframe" (Log Tool)

Format: A simple, repeatable logging tool.

User Action: When the user catches themselves in a harsh judgment (of self or other):

Log It (Text): "I judged my co-worker for being 'lazy' in the meeting."

Find the Mirror (Checkbox/Text): The app asks, "Where is this true for you? (Where are you 'lazy'? Or where do you wish you could be 'lazy'?)."

Find the Fear (Text): "What does this judgment protect you from? (e.g., 'It protects me from my own laziness, which I fear. If I'm lazy, I'll fail.')."

Find the Gold (Dropdown): "What hidden value is in this judgment?" (e.g., Productivity, Efficiency, Fairness, Contribution).

Result: The app creates a "Judgment Log" that reframes judgments as data. It shows the user that their judgments aren't random; they are a direct, though painful, expression of their most deeply held (and often unmet) values.

Module 7: The Rebel (The Shadow of Defiance)

Expanded Concepts (What is it?)

The Archetype: The Rebel is a reactive archetype, often born from a controlling (Tyrant) upbringing or environment. It feels so suffocated by rules that it must defy them all to feel free. The "shadow" Rebel is self-destructive—it breaks rules that are good for it (like a budget, a health routine, or a loving commitment) just because it hates the feeling of being "trapped" or "told what to do."

Internal Voice: "You can't make me." "I'll show them." "Who cares about the rules?" "Don't fence me in."

How it Affects Your Life:

At Work: You have a "problem with authority." You'll clash with your boss, resent any structure (even helpful processes), and may get fired for "not being a team player." You'll miss deadlines on principle if you feel micromanaged.

In Relationships: You are commitment-phobic. The second a relationship becomes "official" or "serious," you feel an overwhelming urge to run. You equate any expectation or compromise (like "where should we go for dinner?") with being controlled and suffocated.

Internal: Your life feels chaotic, unstable, and reactive. You are a "leaf in the wind," defined by what you are against rather than what you are for. You crave freedom but end up trapped by the consequences of your own impulsive choices.

The "Gold" (Hidden Strength): True authenticity, a powerful "B.S. detector," the courage to question authority, and the revolutionary spirit to change outdated, unjust, or inefficient systems.

Webapp Activity: "Reactive vs. Authentic 'No'" (Scenario Quiz)

Format: A "Tinder-style" quiz. The app presents scenarios. The user "swipes" to categorize.

User Action:

Scenario: "Your doctor tells you to eat healthier."

Swipe Left: Reactive "No" ("You can't tell me what to do! I'll eat what I want.") -> This is the Shadow Rebel (self-sabotage).

Swipe Right: Authentic "No" ("I will not follow this specific diet, but I will find a healthy-eating path that feels authentic to me.") -> This is the Golden Rebel (autonomy).

Scenario: "Your partner asks you to move in together."

Swipe Left: Reactive "No" ("I feel trapped! I have to get out! starts a fight")

Swipe Right: Authentic "No" ("I value this relationship, but I need to be honest that I'm not ready for that step because I value my own space.")

Result: The app gives instant feedback on each swipe, explaining the crucial difference between self-destructive reactivity and authentic autonomy. This trains the user to pause before reacting.

Module 8: Integration: Your "Inner Council" Dashboard

Objective: To provide the user with a dynamic, ongoing tool for self-awareness, transforming the app from a "course" into a "companion."

Concept: The work is never "done." These archetypes are not enemies to be vanquished; they are parts of you to be understood. The goal is to move from being possessed by these archetypes to being the conscious leader of them. You are the CEO, and they are your "Inner Council," each with a valuable (if loud) perspective.

Webapp Activity: "The Archetype Dashboard"

Format: A personalized homepage for the user. It shows all 6 (or 8, 12, etc.) archetypes.

User Action:

Weekly Check-in: The app prompts, "Who is 'loudest' on your council this week? Let's check in."

Sliders: The user uses sliders (0-100) to adjust the "volume" of each archetype based on their week.

Example: This week, my Martyr is at 90% (I'm burned out from over-giving), and my Judge is at 70% (I'm being hard on myself for it). My Victim is also at 60% (I'm blaming my boss).

Result (Dynamic Feedback): Based on the highest-scoring archetypes, the dashboard dynamically pulls in the most relevant "Integration Tool" from the modules.

Example: Because the Martyr is at 90%, the dashboard's main "To-Do" is: "Your Martyr is loud. This is a sign you're ignoring your own needs. Let's use the 'Yes/No' Need Sorter to practice a 'Boundaried No' today."

Because the Judge is high, a secondary prompt might be: "Your Judge is also active. Let's use the Judgment Tracker to find the value hidden in your self-criticism."

This turns the app from a linear "course" into a lifelong, adaptive "toolkit."
